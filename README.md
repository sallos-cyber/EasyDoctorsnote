Project Title:
EasyDoctorsnote



Description:
When your child is sick, it's important to notify the school about their 
absence, and you may also need to cancel lunch for those days. This app
simplifies the process by allowing you to select a specific date or 
date range and automatically send the necessary emails. To use the app,
you'll need to configure it with an SMTP server and a password. 
It does not access any information on your phone.
